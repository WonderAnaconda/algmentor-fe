    <p>Trading isn’t just a mental game. It’s also a physiological one. Every decision you make during the day is filtered through your body’s chemistry. And two hormones, in particular, have an outsized influence on how you respond to risk, uncertainty, and pressure: cortisol and testosterone.</p>

    <p>Most traders think of these as background noise, if they think of them at all. But if you’ve ever wondered why you feel hesitant in the morning and overly confident after a winning streak, your hormones probably played a role. The good news is, you can learn to work with your biology instead of being blindsided by it.</p>

    <h2>The Morning Spike: Cortisol and the Urge to Play It Safe</h2>

    <p>Cortisol is your body’s main stress hormone. It spikes shortly after you wake up, helping you feel alert and focused. This is known as the Cortisol Awakening Response. It’s part of what helps you transition from sleep into action. But cortisol doesn’t just make you alert, it also makes you cautious. Too much of it can increase your sensitivity to losses and push you toward overly defensive trading.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever exited a position too early, or hesitated to re-enter after a stop-out, cortisol may have been in the driver’s seat. That spike in the morning? It can cloud your risk perception and make you second-guess even well-reasoned setups.</p>

    <p><strong>Supporting studies:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kudielka et al. (2004) found that cortisol levels early in the day affect executive function and emotional reactivity.</li>
      <li>Coates and Herbert (2008) observed that traders with elevated cortisol took significantly less risk during volatile periods, even when it was irrational to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Shows Up in Trading</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early morning:</strong> You're sharp, but defensive. You may cut winners too early or skip trades altogether.</li>
      <li><strong>Midday and later:</strong> Cortisol levels decline, reducing stress but also lowering focus. Impulsivity becomes more likely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testosterone: Confidence, Momentum, and the Risk of Overreach</h2>

    <p>Testosterone tends to get a bad rap in trading circles, but it’s not inherently reckless. It supports drive, confidence, and persistence. In fact, a well-timed boost can help you stay committed to a trade when the market gets choppy. But when testosterone spikes too high, especially after a string of wins, it can lead to overconfidence, position oversizing, and unnecessary risk taking.</p>

    <p>This is particularly dangerous when it happens in the second half of the day, when cortisol is lower and there’s less emotional regulation to balance things out. It’s a recipe for impulsive entries and holding trades far past their logical exit.</p>

    <p><strong>What the research says:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coates and Herbert (2008) found that testosterone levels rose after successful trading days, and that these increases often led to higher risk taking the next day.</li>
      <li>Carney et al. (2010) showed that elevated testosterone was linked to dominant, more aggressive decision-making, even in non-trading scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How This Plays Out in the Market</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>After wins:</strong> You feel unstoppable. You start sizing up, skipping confirmations, and entering earlier.</li>
      <li><strong>After losses:</strong> Testosterone dips, confidence takes a hit, and you may hesitate on setups you’d normally take without question.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools to Keep Your Hormones in Check</h2>

    <p>You can’t eliminate hormonal fluctuations. But you can shape them. What you eat, drink, and do before the session opens has a real effect on how your body responds to market stress and success.</p>

    <h3>Green Tea Over Coffee (Yes, Really)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green tea:</strong> Contains L-theanine, which calms the nervous system without dulling focus. It helps ease cortisol reactivity while keeping you alert.</li>
      <li><strong>Black tea:</strong> Similar benefits. In one study, black tea reduced cortisol recovery time after stress (Steptoe et al., 2007).</li>
      <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Good for a jolt, but it also spikes cortisol. Use it sparingly, especially if you’re already wired before the bell.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to Cut Out (Or Keep Away from Trading Hours)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Reduces testosterone for up to 24 hours. Also disrupts cortisol rhythm and sleep quality. If you drink the night before, expect degraded performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Nicotine:</strong> Temporarily sharpens attention but worsens stress sensitivity over time. Not a good tradeoff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Supplements That Can Help</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> Well-documented cortisol modulator. In a 2012 study by Chandrasekhar et al., it significantly reduced stress-related symptoms in adults.</li>
      <li><strong>Zinc and magnesium:</strong> Support healthy testosterone production and aid sleep. Most traders are deficient in both.</li>
      <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Key for testosterone regulation. Low levels are associated with blunted hormonal response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Daily Routine That Works With Your Hormones</h2>

    <p>Here’s a rough template that lines up your trading with your biology. Think of it as a circuit breaker against bad decisions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>07:00:</strong> Wake up. Get natural light within 15 minutes. No caffeine yet. Hydrate with water and a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li><strong>07:30:</strong> Eat a high-fat, high-protein breakfast. Think eggs, avocado, nuts. Keeps blood sugar stable and cortisol steady.</li>
      <li><strong>08:00:</strong> Take 5 to 10 minutes to breathe, meditate, or stretch. This is your anti-FOMO buffer before market open.</li>
      <li><strong>09:30–11:00:</strong> Trade high-conviction setups. You’re alert, focused, and mentally sharp. Just watch for over-defensiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>11:30–14:00:</strong> Lower cortisol and higher testosterone create a tempting mix. Stick to rules, not instincts.</li>
      <li><strong>14:00–16:00:</strong> Fatigue sets in. Only execute setups you planned ahead. Avoid reacting to the screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Light movement, no alcohol, and wind down early. Supplement with magnesium or zinc if needed. Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>Markets don’t just test your strategy. They test your state. Learning to recognize when your biology is helping or hurting you is one of the most overlooked skills in trading. If you can manage your emotional state at a hormonal level, you don’t just trade better—you think clearer, react faster, and stay more consistent.</p>

    <p>Forget trying to become a machine. Learn to master the one you’re already in.</p>

    <p>The average trader fails not because of bad strategies, but because they think like a normal person. Normal fears. Normal expectations. Normal behavior. In trading, those things get punished. Hard.</p>

    <p>Tom Hougaard has seen over 100 million trades. He’s not just theorizing—he’s watched real people lose money the same way, over and over. And the lesson is brutally simple: if you think like the herd, you’ll lose like the herd.</p>

    <h2>The Real Problem Isn’t Strategy—It’s You</h2>

    <p>You can master MACD, RSI, candlesticks, Fibonacci—all of it. But it won’t stop you from sabotaging your trades. Why? Because when the pressure hits, you default to survival mode. That means cutting winners too early, holding losers too long, or hesitating on setups you planned for hours.</p>

    <p>And this isn’t random. It’s human nature. Most traders act based on emotion, not execution. The market punishes emotion. If you let fear or hope make decisions, your account bleeds.</p>

    <h3>Signs You’re Trading Like Everyone Else</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refusing to take a stop loss because “it’ll bounce back.”</li>
      <li>Doubling down to recover from a loss.</li>
      <li>Exiting a trade the second it turns green—then watching it run without you.</li>
      <li>Hesitating to re-enter after a loss, even when the setup is strong.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fear Is the Hidden Cost in Every Trade</h2>

    <p>Hougaard trades £750 per point. That’s more than most people make in a day—or week. But he’s not fearless. He’s conditioned. Fear doesn’t disappear. It gets blunted by exposure, repetition, and training.</p>

    <p>The average trader’s brain panics under pressure. That’s not weakness—it’s biology. But unless you rewire your reaction to fear, you’ll keep making the same costly mistakes.</p>

    <h3>Here’s How Fear Distorts Performance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It makes you overestimate risk on strong setups.</li>
      <li>It makes you exit too soon to “lock in” tiny gains.</li>
      <li>It pushes you to “wait for confirmation” until it’s too late.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prediction Is a Trap—Trade Without Needing to Be Right</h2>

    <p>One of the hardest truths: entries are basically random. You don’t know if a trade will work. Neither does anyone else. What matters is what you do after you’re in.</p>

    <p>Most traders get obsessed with being right. But the best traders manage risk, not outcomes. The sooner you drop the need to predict, the faster you grow.</p>

    <p>This changes how you view setups. It stops you from marrying a bias. It forces you to prepare for both outcomes—and act decisively either way.</p>

    <h2>Technical Analysis Isn’t the Holy Grail</h2>

    <p>If 75 to 90 percent of retail traders lose, and they all use the same indicators, the math should tell you something: the tools aren’t the issue. The operator is.</p>

    <p>Indicators give structure. But they don’t fix fear. They won’t stop you from breaking your rules. That’s an internal problem, not an analytical one.</p>

    <h3>Why Most Traders Fail Despite Knowing the Same Tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They interpret signals emotionally, not systematically.</li>
      <li>They override their plans when price moves against them.</li>
      <li>They chase setups after missing the ideal entry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Makes Permanent, Not Perfect</h2>

    <p>Every trade you take reinforces a behavior. If you repeatedly exit early or ignore your stop, you’re teaching your brain to keep doing that. Over time, it becomes your default.</p>

    <p>You don’t rise to the level of your strategy. You fall to the level of your trained instincts. That’s why most traders plateau—even when they “know better.”</p>

    <h3>Train the Right Way</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Run simulations where you follow your plan no matter what.</li>
      <li>Journal trades with focus on behavior, not just results.</li>
      <li>Replay past trades and rehearse the correct response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought: You’re Not Broken—You’re Just Untrained</h2>

    <p>The market is a mirror. It shows you exactly how you handle stress, uncertainty, and loss. The difference between amateurs and professionals isn’t talent. It’s response training.</p>

    <p>Forget being right. Get good at doing the right thing, no matter how it feels. That’s how you stop trading like everyone else—and start trading like someone who wins.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Every tick in your favor triggers a chemical cascade that most traders never even notice. Make money in scalping, and your brain rewards you with a cocktail of hormones designed for survival, not rational decision-making.</p>
    
    <h2>Dopamine: The Hit That Hooks You</h2>
    <p>Score a win, and dopamine floods your system. It’s the same neurotransmitter that powers gambling, social media, and drug addiction. In trading, this spike makes you crave more action—clouding judgment, fueling revenge trades, and making every tick feel personal.</p>

    <h2>Testosterone: The Winner Effect</h2>
    <p>Land a series of successful scalps and testosterone rises. Studies on traders (see Coates & Herbert, 2008) show winning streaks spike testosterone, boosting confidence and risk tolerance. That can help in the short run, but also pushes you toward bigger, bolder trades—and greater risk of a crash.</p>

    <h2>Cortisol: Stress Drops, Caution Fades</h2>
    <p>Profitable trades lower cortisol, the stress hormone. Less anxiety feels good, but it’s a trap: reduced caution can lead you to take setups you’d normally avoid, or risk more after a win. Overconfidence and lower stress mean less restraint—prime conditions for the next big loss.</p>

    <h2>Adrenaline: The Rush</h2>
    <p>Scalping is fast and high stakes. The adrenaline rush sharpens your focus, but too much over time burns you out. Wins reinforce the cycle, keeping you hooked on action over discipline.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Cycle: How Hormones Shape Your Edge—and Your Downfall</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Win → Dopamine/Testosterone up → Feels good → Trade more.</b></li>
      <li><b>Trade more → Caution drops (cortisol down) → Risk increases.</b></li>
      <li><b>Lose → Dopamine crash → Chase losses.</b></li>
      <li><b>Repeat. Spiral.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Break the Cycle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Set strict rules before trading. Never adjust risk size after a win.</b></li>
      <li><b>Use cool-downs after profits—force a pause to reset hormones.</b></li>
      <li><b>Journal how you feel after each trade. If you notice increased confidence or urgency, step away.</b></li>
      <li><b>Remind yourself: the market punishes emotional trading, not bad luck.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recognize the biochemical game behind your urge to keep trading. Every win feels like skill. Most of it is brain chemistry, and it’s built to make you lose. Outsmart your own biology—or you’ll be just another trader feeding the machine.</p>
