- **Scenario Analysis:**  
  - Let users simulate “what if” scenarios for rule changes.

### Automation & Integration

- **Community & Support:**  
  - Build forums, FAQs, and responsive support for user trust and retention.

To dominate the market:
- Focus on **deeper context**, **customization**, **real-time automation**, and **UX.**
- Remember: **User onboarding, engagement, and education** are now your primary bottlenecks—not analysis quality.
